This is ITPROG Phase 1 -- improved.

To run this code, make sure that in app.js, credentials to connect to the database is correct.
1. change password to what seems appropriate for the workspace (e.g., p@ssword if your device has the password as such, leave empty if none)
2. change user if necessary, but keep it as root.
3. database should be dbclient_side.
4. change the port as well if is a different port (in my case, I have 3307 in my personal device, normally it should be 3306).


To run the application altogether:
1. Go to terminal / cmd
2. Put the path wherein it concerns this machine project (yourdirectory/ITPROG_MPv2)
3. simply type in "node app" (without quotation marks), then the application will be good to go.
